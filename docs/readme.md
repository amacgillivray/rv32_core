Linear Algebra Accelerator
==========================

**Overview:** The *Linear Algebra Accelerator* project (LAA) is an open-source project providing an FPGA-based accelerator for programs using linear algebra. The accelerator provides a number of RISC-V cores supporting the RVV extension. It also provides a Daemon program to accept and handle requests to use that accelerator, and a C++ library to simplify sending those requests.

This is a capstone project by 5 senior CS students at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.
